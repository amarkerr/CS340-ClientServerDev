How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

Additionally,<br/> 
- Consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two.
- What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?<br/>
***
There are clear advantages to working with a CRUD module outside of the dashboard functionalities. The largest typically are making easy edits to the module and utilizing it for other dashboard programs. Since the CRUD module includes simple CRUD methods for MongoDB functionalities, it can easily be applied to any other database dashboard where the developer is utilizing MongoDB.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?

Additionally,<br/> 
- Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested.
- How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses?
- What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?<br/>

I start by working with what I know and carve out time and tasks for what I don't. This allows me to build a plan and structure for any project quickly. I used this approach with the dashboard as I do with many of my other projects. I completed the imports, instantiation, and connections first. Then, I started building the visual pieces like the header and graph. For these sections, I started writing the code I knew, commented out half-completed portions, and utilized FIXMEs as notes for what I wanted to work on. From there, I used the appropriate resources to learn how to complete any unfinished code and implement what I wanted to. In the future, I would use a similar strategy. A client with clear outlines easily lets me use this same process.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?

Additionally,<br/> 
- How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?<br/>
***
This company now has an effortless way to view their data and find exactly what they are searching for. Any company working with data that requires searching and narrowing down results depends on tools that make this simple. A simple dashboard like the one created for this project will now save staff countless work hours, and it can be reproduced to suit other data needs in less time than the original product had taken to produce, resulting in even more work hours saved.
